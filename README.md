# GPT4All-Compat
GPT4All Streaming Compatibility Layer

This is a personal project I started to attempt to make a compatibility layer for programs like Cline to be able to use GPT4All, despite GPT4All not having streaming support. There are some know issues with it, including how it occasionally removes the white space at that start of new chunks when it stitches them back together. For now, I'm a bit tired of tinkering with it, so I'm releasing it as MIT licensed.
